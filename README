The main idea is to include priority_queue.h in the tests and compile against the different structures as desired.
Different ifdefs are used to declare different structs, definitions and auxiliary functions.
Tests should only use the common priority queue interface and NOT the auxiliary functions that might be defined for each implementation.
In the same way, test code should not access the structures' inner fields unless you found a bug and you know what you're doing.

Compilation example: (in src/tests)

gcc -g -D_BINARY_HEAP pq_basic_test ../structures/binomial_heap.c -o test

Extra compilation notes:

- Binomial heap requires linking against math library (-lm flag)
